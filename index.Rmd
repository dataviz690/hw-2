Prepare a dashboard using the **mtcars** data. You need to write the code to actually replicate the same plots you are seeing.

1.  Send the link to the code in a GitHub repository
2.  Dashboard should be published from a GitHub repo
3.  The README should include the dashboard link.

**NOTE**: You may vary titles and colors.
